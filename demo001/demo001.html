    <h1>My First Lottie Animation</h1>

    <div style="width:30%; height:30%; margin: auto;" id="bm"></div>
    <br>
    
        <p>Above is an animated shape made in After Effects and exported as a  <a href="https://airbnb.design/introducing-lottie/">Lottie</a>  (.json) file with the
        <a href="https://aescripts.com/bodymovin/">Bodymovin plugin</a>.</p>

        <p>I created this Webpage using HTML and CSS, and used the
             Lottie Web Player, which is a block of JavaScript code, to embed the 
             Lottie Animation.</p>
        <p>Why do this? Why not use a .gif or MPG4 video?</p>

        <p>Lottie animations are not pixel based, they are code based, in the form of an SVG (scalable vector graphics). </p>
        <p>This means that they are lightweight, with small file sizes, scalable and can be responsive (try scaling this browser window). </p>
        <p>They are great for building animation into interactive apps, on the Web or for mobile or desktop apps.</p>
        <p>You can add lots of cool interactivty via code and make rich interactive user interfaces.</p>
        <p>I'm experimenting with this as a way to create a solution for Leigh Woods.
